# Mapping-Earthquakes

## Overview & Purpose
This project creats an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. It displays the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and also shows all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and we also would like to see the data on a third map.



## Results
- The below image was an interactive map displays all locations around the world that has earthquakes. The circle-marker's size and color was correlated to the earthquake's magnitude. Specifically, the light color means the earthquake is lower than red color.

- The map with tectonic plates below only provides major earthquakes (4.5 magnitude and above)

- A 3rd map with dark view displays all earthquakes with black map background
